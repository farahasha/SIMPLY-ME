              <p>
                    I may have been able to answer some of your questions about it, and now I'll tell you more if you want.
                My name is Farah Abdel Rahman Asha. I studied at the Hashemite University as a class teacher and graduated with a very good grade. I volunteered throughout my studies with many institutions.
                I am in love with mathematics more than anything else in life.
                And my love for technology is what led me to you today so you can see my page.
          A problem when you are an ambitious person, you are looking for science and knowledge everywhere just like me,  Also being a mother of two children you can imagine, I'm still young it's just 27 years but it's okay, one day I will eat them, Sometimes you will think that I am crazy, but that's okay, this is the effect of working as a teacher for children for 3 years, when you work with them, you will be attracted to their world and forget the existence of the whole world.
